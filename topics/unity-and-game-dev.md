# Unity and Game Dev

## Unity

* What is a game engine: Think Xcode for building games. Gives you everything necessary to build a game without worrying about how it renders and builds. It does **not** provide your final artwork and assets. It simply allows you to tie them tall together with your code.
* Keep scenes in an **Assets/\_Scenes** folder.
* A prefab is a game object that stores several assets together \(3d models, materials, animations, etc\).
* **Project Setup**
  * Each frame in a game render as they are needed. You want to aim for a render speed of 60fps or higher. Window -&gt; Lighting -&gt; Settings. Uncheck "Realtime Global Illumination" and "Baked Global Illumination". Also uncheck "Auto Generate" at the bottom. Then close the window. \(Look up what these do later on.\)
  * Edit -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Player. In the "Other Settings" section of the window, change the "Color Space" to "Linear".
  * Edit -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Quality. Delete all except "Fastest" and "Fantastic". Rename "Fastest" to "Low Quality". Change the texture quality to "Quarter Res". Rename "Fantastic" to "High Quality".
  * Drag objects/prefabs from the project window to the hierarchy window to place them in the scene. Press F to center around the object.
* **Camera**

  * Place the camera in the scene by clicking on the "Game" tab at the top. Then click on the "Main Camera" in the Hierarchy window. Type the [position you want](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/position-the-camera) the starting point camera to be in in the Inspector window's "Transform" section. Next change the clipping planes to be what your game needs. Then you write the code for the camera to follow the player.
  * Simple camera affects: Asset Store -&gt; Post Processing Stack -&gt; Import. Main Camera -&gt; Add Component -&gt; Post Processing Behavior. Prefabs -&gt; Right Click -&gt; Create -&gt; Post Processing Profile -&gt; Name it. Drag it into the main camera's created component. Select the profile in the project window. Play with options.

* **Scripts**

  * Select the object that the script will control in the Hierarchy Window. Add Component -&gt; New Script -&gt; Name the script \(one word, camel case with capital first letter, as it will be the class name\) -&gt; hit enter. Make sure to move the script to the **Scripts** folder \(Unity stores it in the main **Assets** folder by default.\)
  * After saving the script, also hit Cmd + S in Unity to save the scene.

* **UnityEngine**

  * **Input.GetAxisRaw\(\)**: Takes a string either `"Vertical"` or `"Horizontal"` and returns a float from **-1** to **1** stating whether the user is trying to move in the current frame.
  * **void FixedUpdate\(\)**: Used to update animator components that rely on physics. This happens after the Update method, but not as often.

* **Tips**

  * After adding any assets with their own lighting, go to Window -&gt; Lighting -&gt; Settings and click "Generate Lighting".
  * Hotkeys: Alt click+drag. F, Q, W, E, R, Z, and X.
  * Use the Asset Store for things that may come in handy.
  * The Y axis in `Verctor3` is up, like a jump. Not up like a vertical movement.
  * Manipulate the RigidBody of the object, not the transform itself. RigidBody is affected by physics, so if some other force is acting on the object at the same time, RigidBody will intelligently calculate where the object should be. Transform will not do that.
  * You can expose class properties to the inspector window. This is helpful for locking one object's value to the value of another object's property. \(E.g: The playerTransform property in the camera object to the actual player object's transform value\).

## Process

1. Ideation
   1. Satisfy this requirement first: "It turns out that it boils down to a kind of pragmatic freedom to roam coupled with an odd combination of social factors. The fundamental human desire to master an environment in concert with the stories that these games generate for the player seems to be utterly compelling, independent of any idea of skill, progression â€¦ or even the game being actually finished and fully playable. You could lose years trying to figure this out fully."
   2. Next come up with new and interesting characters that can be latched on to \(and easily promoted\). With full backstories. \("You should know how much change is in their pockets at any given time."\)
   3. Then come up with an amazing story arc and backdrop. \(Feel free to use inspiration from sources we've screenshot and saved\).
   4. Finally solidify your revenue streams for this particular game. Ads only? IAP to get rid of ads? Other IAPs? Also, if you're self publishing, what's the marketing budget? IG Ads? FB Ads? Influencers? 
2. Production
   1. Design: 
      1. Deciding _how_ the game should play and feel \(What are the perfect settings and platforms for the game? If it's mobile it should pass the toilet test **and** the quick show off test. If console then the Saturday on my own test \(Jak and Daxter, Uncharted\) **or** the party/everyone will have fun test \(Wii Sports, Rocket League\). 2D vs 3D? Sound effects inspirations. Soundrack inspirations. Overall mood? Physics inspirations.\) 
      2. Upon first playing the game, how are your subjects gifted with **surprise and delight**. How is the game both **new** and **recognizable** at the same time?
      3. What are the set of problems that your subject has to solve? 
      4. How do these problems vary in design and difficulty \(levels\)? 
      5. What are the risks and rewards that they have to balance at any given moment?
      6. What makes this game **remarkable**? Are there inherent viral attributes? Is there something particurlaly different? Why will this game spread like wildfire?
      7. How will you build strong IP? \(Strong, recognizable characters and symbols\). How will you profit off of the IP? Should you work with a publicist to treat the IP like a celebrity? Licensing deals? Selling merch? Daily vlog? 
      8. 9. 
   2. Art & Assets: 
      1. 3D Models
         1. Characters should have both an idle animation, and a movement animation component for when the user is actively moving.
      2. Textures
      3. Level UI
      4. Scripts
      5. Sound Effects
      6. Music
   3. Development
      1. First import and setup the environment, player, camera \(FPS, following player, etc\), and camera effects for the level.
      2. Next handle any pickups that the player can grab.
      3. Score
      4. Enemies and Game State
      5. Audio
      6. Monetization and Analytics
      7. Secondary Assets
         1. Gameplay videos
         2. Images \(Screenshots, Gifs, Logos\)
         3. 
   4. QA and Playtesting
3. Publish
   1. Publishers: Developer Digital, Paradox, Surprise Attack, tinyBuild, Indie Fund, Team 17, Adult Swim Games, Finji, Devolver, Curve, Double Fine
   2. What are they going to do for you? What do you want done? Do these match?
   3. Eventually you want to erase these step by step and keep a larger piece of the pie. So first you're looking for funding for all three, then just marketing and distribution, and finally just distribution \(keeping 85% of the money\). \(150M in company stock, 5M in overhead for 5 years, 25M to finance acquisitions for the business, 10M for each project for a minimum of three\).
   4. **Production** **Funding**: How much upfront \(enough to last me until the game launches plus 3 months after, plus profit\)? Money usage rules? How much on the backend and at what point? How does that backend money flow? Who cuts the checks? In what increments?
   5. **Marketing** \[PR, Advertising, Events\]: Who exactly runs the PR? Is it just North America? Do they include streamers, Youtubers, and other social media? How are they spending advertising money, and where? What events do they go to and what happens there? Is their cohesion in their campaigning? Can they build excitement toward a release date
   6. **Distribution** \[digital, retail, merch, direct\]: Placement on storefronts? Inclusion in promotions, merchandising? Cross promotion?
   7. Who have they worked with before? How did it go? \(Go talk to them, and the ones that didn't sell many copies\)
   8. Do they believe in and are they excited about the game?
   9. In their past work, does the game have more visibility than the publisher's name?
   10. IP: IP is under no circumstances up for grabs. Owned by the developer's studio.
4. Squeeze as much as you can out of it.
5. Sell: Maple Media
