# Unity and Game Dev

## Unity

* What is a game engine: Think Xcode for building games. Gives you everything necessary to build a game without worrying about how it renders and builds. It does **not** provide your final artwork and assets. It simply allows you to tie them tall together with your code.

## Process

1. Ideation
   1. Satisfy this requirement first: "It turns out that it boils down to a kind of pragmatic freedom to roam coupled with an odd combination of social factors. The fundamental human desire to master an environment in concert with the stories that these games generate for the player seems to be utterly compelling, independent of any idea of skill, progression â€¦ or even the game being actually finished and fully playable. You could lose years trying to figure this out fully."
   2. Next come up with new and interesting characters that can be latched on to \(and easily promoted\). With full backstories. \("You should know how much change is in their pockets at any given time."\)
   3. Then come up with an amazing story arc and backdrop. \(Feel free to use inspiration from sources we've screenshot and saved\).
   4. Finally solidify your revenue streams for this particular game. Ads only? IAP to get rid of ads? Other IAPs? Also, if you're self publishing, what's the marketing budget? IG Ads? FB Ads? Influencers? 
2. Production
   1. Design: 
      1. Deciding _how_ the game should play and feel \(Which platforms? 2D vs 3D? Sound effects inspirations. Soundrack inspirations. Overall mood? Physics inspirations.\) 
      2. What are the set of problems that your subject has to solve? 
      3. How do they vary in design and difficulty \(levels\)? 
      4. What are the risks and rewards that they have to balance at any given moment?
      5. What makes this game remarkable? Are there inherent viral attributes? Is there something particurlaly different? Why will this game spread like wildfire?
   2. Art & Assets: 
      1. 3D Models
      2. Textures
      3. Level UI
      4. Scripts
      5. Sound Effects
      6. Music
   3. Development
   4. QA and Playtesting
3. Publish: developer digital Paradox  Surprise Attack tinyBuild  indie fund team 17 adult swim games finji devolver curve double fine
   1. What are they going to do for you? What do you want done? Do these match?
   2. Eventually you want to erase these step by step and keep a larger piece of the pie. So first you're looking for funding for all three, then just marketing and distribution, and finally just distribution \(keeping 85% of the money\). \(150M in company stock, 5M in overhead for 5 years, 25M to finance acquisitions for the business, 10M for each project for a minimum of three\).
   3. **Production** **Funding**: How much upfront \(enough to last me until the game launches plus 3 months after, plus profit\)? Money usage rules? How much on the backend and at what point? How does that backend money flow? Who cuts the checks? In what increments?
   4. **Marketing** \[PR, Advertising, Events\]: Who exactly runs the PR? Is it just North America? Do they include streamers, Youtubers, and other social media? How are they spending advertising money, and where? What events do they go to and what happens there? Is their cohesion in their campaigning? Can they build excitement toward a release date
   5. **Distribution** \[digital, retail, merch, direct\]: Placement on storefronts? Inclusion in promotions, merchandising? Cross promotion?
   6. Who have they worked with before? How did it go? \(Go talk to them, and the ones that didn't sell many copies\)
   7. Do they believe in and are they excited about the game?
   8. In their past work, does the game have more visibility than the publisher's name?
   9. IP: IP is under no circumstances up for grabs. Owned by the developer's studio.
4. Squeeze as much as you can out of it.
5. Sell: Maple Media
