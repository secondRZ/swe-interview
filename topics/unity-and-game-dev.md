# Unity and Game Dev

## Process

1. Planning
   1. "It turns out that it boils down to a kind of pragmatic freedom to roam coupled with an odd combination of social factors. The fundamental human desire to master an environment in concert with the stories that these games generate for the player seems to be utterly compelling, independent of any idea of skill, progression â€¦ or even the game being actually finished and fully playable. You could lose years trying to figure this out fully."
   2. Art and design.
   3. Amazing story.
   4. Interesting characters that can be latched on to \(and easily promoted\).
2. Production
   1. Design
   2. Art & Assets
   3. Development
   4. QA and Playtesting
3. Publish: developer digital Paradox  Surprise Attack tinyBuild  indie fund team 17 adult swim games finji devolver curve double fine
   1. What are they going to do for you? What do you want done? Do these match?
   2. **Funding** to finish development: How much upfront \(enough to last me until the game launches plus 3 months after, plus profit\)? Money usage rules? How much on the backend and at what point? How does that backend money flow? Who cuts the checks? In what increments?
   3. **Marketing** \[PR, Advertising, Events\]: Who exactly runs the PR? Is it just North America? Do they include streamers, Youtubers, and other social media? How are they spending advertising money, and where? What events do they go to and what happens there? Is their cohesion in their campaigning? Can they build excitement toward a release date
   4. **Production** \[Testing, loc, voiceover, music\]:
   5. **Distribution** \[digital, retail, merch, direct\]: Placement on storefronts? Inclusion in promotions, merchandising? Cross promotion?
   6. Who have they worked with before? How did it go? \(Go talk to them, and the ones that didn't sell many copies\)
   7. Do they believe in and are they excited about the game?
   8. In their past work, does the game have more visibility than the publisher's name?
   9. IP: IP is under no circumstances up for grabs. Owned by the developer's studio.
4. Squeeze as much as you can out of it.
5. Sell: Maple Media
