# C\# Details

## Program Structure

* Namespaces should be `CompanyName.ActualNamespace` and can be accessed from different files, so you can still give each class its own file.
* The `var` keyword only works when the assignment comes at the same time. `var some_int;` wouldn't work.
* Just like C++, you can use `using SomeNameSpace;` at the top to avoid typing it every time, but it's better not to.
* You can make a variable/property read only with the `readonly` keyword before its type: `public readonly int height;`.
* Accept input from a user:

```java
static void Main() {
    System.Console.Write("Enter how many minutes you exercised: ");    
    string entry = System.Console.ReadLine();
}
```

## OOP

* Properties and methods default to `private` access. Even the constructor has to be made `public`.

## Data Types

* `variable.GetType()` will return the type of the variable.
* **bool**
* **string**: Always between two quotes.
  * `ToLower("C")` and `ToUpper("c")`
* **int**:
  * `int.Parse("55");` returns the converted `string` **55** into an `int`.
