# Software Engineering Interview Preparation

The goal of this summary is to contain all the required theoretical material needed to pass a Facebook/Google software engineering interview, but (hopefully) no more than that. It originated out of my own personal notes while preparing for such interviews. I view it as an executive summary, that should ideally take a few hours to read, and that you should read multiple times while preparing for the interview. See [this post](https://orrsella.com/2016/05/14/preparing-for-a-facebook-google-software-engineer-interview/) for more background and tips on preparing for an interview.

Start from [SUMMARY](https://github.com/orrsella/soft-eng-interview-prep/blob/master/SUMMARY.md). It's also available in [GitBook format](https://orrsella.gitbooks.io/soft-eng-interview-prep/content/) for easier reading and navigation.
